# Work Done So Far

As of now, the focus has been on developing small software modules using XDP for various performance analysis tasks. The culmination of this effort is the implementation of a basic NAT64 (Network Address Translation for IPv6 to IPv4 and vice versa) solution using XDP.


## NAT64 Implementation

The recent focus has been on implementing a simple yet effective NAT64 solution leveraging XDP, involving the translation of IPv6 addresses to IPv4 addresses, showcasing its versatility in network function implementations.

## Project Goals
My initial project goals were:

[**Still to be defined**]

- **CPU Performance Analysis**: Measure and analyze CPU performance metrics, such as cycle counts.
- **Cache Analysis**: Monitor cache performance by tracking cache hits and misses across various cache levels.
- **Custom eBPF Tools**: Develop custom eBPF tools using the BCC framework for efficient performance data collection.

## Thesis
This work is part of an ongoing internship, and a detailed thesis will be prepared to provide insights about development, methodology, and findings of the performance analysis project.
